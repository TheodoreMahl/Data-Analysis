# Data-Analysis
**Excel file description:**
A table of state in the United States sorted by various categories. The table was creating by pulling tables from online sources and using vlookup to combine the tables together with a common variable, that being the state name. Col being cost of living and Qol being quality of living. I used conditional formating to shade in red the the above average crime, homicide, and cost of living rates. And the below average quality of life.

**SQL Data Cleaning descriptions:**
The default dataset is a directory of U.S. meat poultry and egg producers. I've cleaned the activities column by creating two new boolean columns. I then set the two new columns to be true or false depending on whether the activities column contained two strings by using the UPDATE command. And then I used the count command to see how many of the plants performed each activity.
