# Data-Analysis
Excel file description:
A table of state in the United States of America sorted by various categories. The table was creating by pulling tables from online sources and using vlookup to combine the tables together with a common variable, that being the state name. Col being cost of living and Qol being quality of living. I used conditional formating to shade in red the the above average crime, homicide, and cost of living rates. And the below average quality of life.
